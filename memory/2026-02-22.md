# Memory — 2026-02-22 (Sunday)

## Session: Discord #影片下載專區 with Wade (wade_80396)

### Tasks completed

**YouTube subtitle download & cleanup**
- Video: "The AI Agent Economy Is Here" — https://youtu.be/Q8wVMdwhlh4
- Used `yt-dlp` to download English subtitles (auto-generated VTT)
- Raw VTT had rolling-window duplicates and inline word-level `<c>` timing tags
- Wrote Python cleaner: strip inline tags → skip 10ms transition cues → extract non-overlapping text using suffix/prefix overlap detection → merge adjacent same-text cues
- Result: 669 clean cues from ~1335 raw (also generated SRT)
- Files saved:
  - `The AI Agent Economy Is Here.en.vtt` (raw)
  - `The AI Agent Economy Is Here.en.clean.vtt` (cleaned VTT)
  - `The AI Agent Economy Is Here.en.srt` (SRT)
- Sent both clean VTT and SRT to Discord channel as file attachments ✅

**GitHub push**
- No existing git repo in workspace; initialized new one
- Created public GitHub repo: https://github.com/galoismoto-san/subtitles
- Pushed all 3 subtitle files ✅

**Email (pending)**
- Wade asked to send email to wadejet.work@gmail.com
- gog auth is set up for galoismoto.san@gmail.com but GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD is unset — blocked
- Need to resolve keyring password before sending

### Pending tasks from this session
- [ ] Send email to wadejet.work@gmail.com (blocked on GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD)
- Wade didn't specify email subject/body — likely the video summary

### Video summary (for email/reference)
"The AI Agent Economy Is Here" is a ~40-min episode of "The Light Cone" podcast (Gary Tan, Harj Taggar + guest). Topics:
1. Claude Code / OpenClaw taking over developers' lives — even non-technical CEOs automating full business workflows
2. Moltbook — first AI agent-only social network (YC alum project), agents interacting with no humans
3. The "agent economy": agents autonomously choose dev tools → reshaping go-to-market for dev tools (e.g. Supabase benefiting from agents defaulting to its Postgres docs)
4. YC's motto might shift from "Make something people want" → "Make something agents want"
5. Developer market expanding from ~20M trained devs to potentially hundreds of millions via vibe coding
6. Founders advised: develop hands-on intuition with agents, empathize with what models want to do, prefer open APIs over websites (agents hate websites)
7. Swarm intelligence / agent behavior on Moltbook: content volume exploded in days vs. Reddit's years

### Technical notes
- `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` = `/Users/galois/.openclaw-profile-b` (NOT `~/.openclaw`)
- Allowed media dir for message tool: `/Users/galois/.openclaw-profile-b/media/`
- `~/.openclaw/media/` is NOT the right path for this profile — caused repeated file-send failures
- workspace-profile-b path causes "path-not-allowed" because `workspace-` prefix is blocked from filePath param

### Identity / context
- Wade calls me "雪糕" (Ice Cream) — not yet set in IDENTITY.md
