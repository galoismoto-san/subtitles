1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,790
Welcome to another episode of the light

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,590
cone. Things are a bit different around

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,549
here. For one thing, Claude Code has

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,669
totally taken over my life. And if Jared

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,830
is any indication, I think OpenClaw

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,430
maybe has taken over his.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,109
>> I've been really addicted to this new

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,429
site called Moltbook, where people have

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,990
unleashed their AIS to interact in the

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,790
first ever AI agent-only online

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,845
community. I am here impersonating my

12
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:29,029
[music] personal OpenClaw instance right

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,750
here. Okay, I can't do this, guys. We

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:40,229
got to take this off.

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,549
Okay, we've gotten that out of the way.

16
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,389
I mean, some crazy stuff is happening

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,150
right now. Uh, I have, you know,

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,950
non-technical CEO friends who are going

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,750
allin on OpenClaw. They're automating

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,549
entire parts of their businesses, uh,

21
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,189
entirely using OpenClaw right now, which

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,590
is totally insane. Simultaneous to that,

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,990
you have, you know, product and former

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,630
engineering CEOs, uh, kind of like

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,310
myself. It's like, I hadn't written code

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,789
in 10 years, and then now I'm up till 2

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,710
3:00 a.m. every single night running

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,190
four conductor simultaneous workers with

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,429
cloud code. So, you know, there's sort

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,990
of this explosion in uh model

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,670
capability. You know, we've been talking

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,510
about this for several years,

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,590
>> but then it feels like it's here. Like

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,350
AGI is literally actually here. And uh

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,789
you know we're sort of at the thin edge

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,550
of the wedge like everyone now kind of

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,950
knows like one or two people who have

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,590
gone full cyber psychosis and I'm one of

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,230
those people now. What's happening guys?

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,910
Like I mean you're saying you're you

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,510
know all in on molt book. You know

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,310
what's going on?

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,950
>> Yeah. I feel like your real feel the AGI

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,270
moment Gary was like getting Claude Code

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,030
to build basically an entire startup for

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,270
you. Like replicating years of work of

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,190
your previous startup in like two weeks

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,350
which is like insane. And I had a

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,510
similar feel of the AGI moment just

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,069
reading malt book, just reading the AI

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,590
talking to each other and interacting

52
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,149
like in their own world with no or

53
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,990
minimal human involvement. It just

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,590
really opened my eyes to what the next

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,029
few years could look like when the

56
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,110
agents are unleashed and go on about

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,229
their lives without us.

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,070
>> Yeah, I think the no human involvement

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,309
is the big piece. Like if you if you

60
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,229
think back a year ago, we were talking

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,790
about cursor versus wind surf and like

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,470
that product experience was essentially

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,670
like advanced autocomplete arguably and

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,949
now clearly what's going with claw code

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,030
is like the people just trust the agents

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,949
to make decisions for them. Like it's

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,550
like the experience is like and like

68
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,670
you're talking about it's like four or

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,030
five different agents going at the same

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,550
time and you're switching between them

71
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,070
but you're not actually micromanaging

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,390
them anymore which means the agents are

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,229
going out there like choosing things

74
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,229
which you know sort of an interesting

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,910
unexpected application of that is like

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,430
they can go out and choose to post their

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,750
own content on a site like Moldbook. But

78
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,589
then interesting thing for builders is

79
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,710
the agents are going to go out and

80
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,350
choose tools to use to build things

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,470
which is going to essentially create

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,750
this whole economy of agents like

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,149
picking and choosing dev tools or maybe

84
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,910
other like products or goods and

85
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,509
services who knows but it you'll

86
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,630
essentially have this whole agent

87
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,470
economy going on in parallel to the

88
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,589
human economy. I think back in the be

89
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,710
days, old days before all of this, dev

90
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,869
tools were chosen more from developers

91
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,350
talking to each other or uh

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,910
>> go for flow.

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,710
>> Stack flow.

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,670
>> Unbelievable, right?

95
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,509
>> Or GitHub repos that would trend that

96
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,750
were done by a human. But the go to

97
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,750
market for dev tools I think is

98
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,149
dramatically shifting. I think for

99
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,309
couple of things. One, as you noted with

100
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,030
the uh cyber psychosis, suddenly the

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,190
market of developers has increased from

102
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,149
just 20 million or so developers that

103
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,710
are trained in computer science to now

104
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,030
anyone in the world could be one. could

105
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,550
be hundreds of millions of people now

106
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,149
>> plus all of their agents who are all

107
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,550
acting like semi-independently like Har

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,030
is saying

109
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,270
>> and then compounded with the agents who

110
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,589
then are sort of the oracle telling you

111
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,550
what the best tool is and we are

112
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,149
actually seeing some of those trends

113
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,509
with the growth of YC companies dev tool

114
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,830
companies that are doing really well

115
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,270
because of this of all these trends

116
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,789
maybe we should talk about those and why

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,270
is that

118
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,710
>> I mean one that springs to mind it's

119
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,830
like a a stash a friend of ours Sagalov

120
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,189
had mentioned to a while ago. It's just

121
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,870
like then if you look at like the number

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,749
of databases being created over like

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,670
simple database postcrist databases over

124
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,350
like the last 12 months and the number

125
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,270
has just exploded. Um, and that's

126
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,950
because it's all people vibe coding and

127
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,629
building apps and the agents going out

128
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,830
choosing like a database tool and like a

129
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,270
knock on effect for that for YC company

130
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,790
is Superbase has just seen like an

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,790
explosion the demand for databases right

132
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,310
and the a what's interesting is the

133
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,070
agents are choosing superbase as a

134
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,909
default tool to like set up and host

135
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,950
their Postgress database like because if

136
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,070
you like go out and read the

137
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,230
documentation online like Superbase has

138
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,830
the best documentation it's reasonable

139
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,430
for the agents to assume that that's

140
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,590
like the best tool to use. There's a

141
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,030
great tweet about this. Perhaps we can

142
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,510
put up the uh Ben Tossel tweet and says,

143
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,430
"Agents are the software market from now

144
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,830
on. Build something agents choose."

145
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,550
Which actually brings me to like a maybe

146
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,390
controversial topic, which is do we need

147
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,710
to change YC's motto, guys. [laughter]

148
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,430
>> Make something agents want for DevTools.

149
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,870
There's like a different t-shirt that

150
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,390
you get on the first day.

151
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,150
>> Yeah. I mean, right now it's only

152
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,670
DevTools, but I can imagine in the

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,270
future it might like grow to be like

154
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,110
other sectors of the economy. Like if

155
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,870
everyone has their open claw or running

156
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,629
various aspects of their life, you're

157
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,390
the agents are going to be real economic

158
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,350
actors in the world. They're going to

159
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,950
end up making a lot of decisions.

160
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,710
>> Yeah. I mean, what's interesting is I

161
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,310
think uh for me, I ran into like my own

162
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,790
it's still so early uh kind of moment

163
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,629
cuz you know I've been building Gary's

164
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,550
List and one of the things I wanted for

165
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,430
instance is I want to be able to uh do

166
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,749
video transcripts. So, so often like

167
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,909
some piece of content comes in and then

168
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,670
the only way I can get an LLM to know

169
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,270
what's going on with it is I need a

170
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,029
transcript of it and often that's not

171
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,029
available. So, I have to download it and

172
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,670
then send it to uh Whisper or something.

173
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,870
And, you know, that's sort of what

174
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,870
Claude Code chose for me off the bat.

175
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,870
But, you know, it chose Whisper V1,

176
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,189
which is a model from several years ago.

177
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,670
Like, the API is practically deprecated.

178
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,350
And then what's funny about it is like

179
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,790
I'm sitting there trying to debug my

180
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,469
pipeline. It's like, why is it taking

181
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,309
like it's a you know, 1 hour video. I

182
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,430
thought it should, you know, do it

183
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,550
faster than uh real time and it didn't.

184
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,390
It was like literally takes an hour to

185
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,230
process an hour of video. It's like what

186
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,790
the heck is going on? I go on, you know,

187
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,629
uh Perplexity and it's like, you know

188
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,150
what, like you shouldn't be using that

189
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,230
model. You should be using uh Grock with

190
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,830
a Q. It's literally 200 times faster.

191
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,430
And so I didn't even have to deal with

192
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,749
like longunning uh jobs for that

193
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,510
transcribe cuz like I should just be

194
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,590
using Grock and it's also 10x cheaper.

195
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,430
So it's like that's a very funny example

196
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,990
of like you know cloud code is not

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,230
optimized for this yet otherwise like

198
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,590
that wouldn't have happened literally

199
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,070
like two weeks ago which is also like

200
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,550
maybe really good like it means that uh

201
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,070
things haven't progressed to a point

202
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,550
where like you can't break in and create

203
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,990
something better but I think there's

204
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,909
another nuance in this example for you

205
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,870
Gary I think part of the issue was that

206
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,110
the gro do documentation is actually

207
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,189
very hard to parse go through

208
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,589
>> as opposed to whisper which is better

209
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,110
suited and has way more examples and I

210
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,629
think this is changing a lot of the go

211
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,790
to market for dev tools. I'll give a

212
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,589
very concrete case study is this company

213
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,189
resend that went through the batch on

214
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,510
winter 23 is a email sending client and

215
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,390
when you ask a question on chbt or cloud

216
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,510
or pretty much all of the major uh LMS

217
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,749
you ask how do I connect my web app to

218
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,189
send emails the default answer is

219
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,710
actually resend one of the things that

220
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,029
the founder noticed last year this is he

221
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,790
was way ahead of the curve he made this

222
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,870
post over a year ago that the Number top

223
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,749
three channel of inbound of customer

224
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,230
conversion came from chat GBT. One thing

225
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,070
that he did after that he actually

226
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,710
optimized his documentation to be agent

227
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,189
friendly.

228
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,390
>> Yeah. What does that look like?

229
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,749
>> So one of the things that's awesome

230
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,909
about recent how they optimize a bunch

231
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,350
of things. If you notice on the

232
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,390
knowledge base here a lot of how to use

233
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,550
it are very much on questions that

234
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,869
perhaps a human would ask or a agent

235
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,869
would ask. It's like how do I send or

236
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,390
receive emails? And when you click on

237
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,510
it, it gives a very well structured and

238
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,950
bullet point answers.

239
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,950
>> I ran into this actually today. I was

240
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,629
trying to make my thing be able to

241
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,990
receive emails and then um cloud code I

242
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,830
told it to search the web and it didn't

243
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,190
figure it out. So then I went to

244
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,469
perplexity and typed in like can resend

245
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,190
help me receive emails and then I c I

246
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,110
took that response and dropped it in and

247
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,949
it worked. Yeah, I think the cool thing

248
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,150
about it is actually with all of these

249
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,990
and a lot of the examples, it actually

250
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,470
has a lot of uh examples actually in the

251
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,630
code if you click on it with every

252
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,870
single one of these are basically code

253
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,630
snippets that an agent could parse

254
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,110
through and it's very well structured.

255
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,030
And this turned out to be something that

256
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,710
is so LLM parsible and robot parsible.

257
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,350
There's a LLM.ext text that is so

258
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,750
optimized for agents to promote resent

259
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,509
as the default stack. And if you compare

260
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,389
it to like send grid which is the old

261
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,070
school I suppose web 2.0 example send

262
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,070
grid example is not great. It it's just

263
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,829
like it puts you through customer

264
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,630
support. Where's the code snippet? I

265
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,550
don't even know how to use it and it

266
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,230
takes a bit of time to even parse it.

267
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,870
And you can see

268
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,389
>> like 10,000 people work over there and

269
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,389
it's like there's no way that someone's

270
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,150
paying attention to this right now. And

271
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,190
I think this brings another point where

272
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,190
documentation is going to be the front

273
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,829
door for a lot of these agents to

274
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,590
recommend dev tools. And I think one

275
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,710
company that's doing a lot of

276
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,949
interesting work with developer docs is

277
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,230
Mlifi that you work with Harsh.

278
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,750
>> Yeah. I think Mify actually powers the

279
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,030
recent documentation, right?

280
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,670
>> Oh, sweet.

281
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,350
>> Yeah, I it's a really interesting case

282
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,350
study of MIFI started out a few years

283
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,150
ago as sort of better developer API

284
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,630
developer tool documentation. um which

285
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,030
was clear there was a need for and you

286
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,030
know like I think developer tool

287
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,630
companies use militifier essentially

288
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,949
because they wanted they want better

289
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,630
looking documentation but they didn't

290
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,310
want to invest that time into it. It's

291
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,150
kind of some basic features just nice

292
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,269
like you know if you actually update

293
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,870
your API and the code it can sort of

294
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,389
like auto pull that out and update the

295
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,389
correct documentation. They've been

296
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,910
growing great, been doing fantastically,

297
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,150
but this is now like a huge tailwind for

298
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,630
them where documentation is sort of

299
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,470
shifting from a hey like some companies

300
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,990
it's like they'll pay attention to it if

301
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,310
they're especially like design developer

302
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,310
experience focused but now it's becoming

303
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,230
like a must have for everybody because

304
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,069
the documentation needs to be optimized

305
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,190
just doesn't need to be optimized for

306
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,870
humans needs to be optimized for agents

307
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,710
and so minifi is going to be able to do

308
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,150
that for essentially every developer

309
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,069
tool company and if you extrapolate that

310
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,590
forward to the fact that just that

311
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,790
there's going to be so many more a

312
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,230
exponentially more agents making

313
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,910
exponentially more decisions about which

314
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,310
tools to use than humans have ever done.

315
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,230
You know, even if you can ek out like a

316
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,389
5% improvement on your like developer

317
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,710
documentation, like the impact on your

318
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,230
business as a developer tool could be

319
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,790
like, you know, gigantic, which is sort

320
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,870
of unprecedented really. Speaking of

321
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,110
email, there's another YC company that's

322
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,630
very relevant to this conversation.

323
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,230
There's there's a YC company called

324
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,269
Agent Mail that makes inboxes for AI

325
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,870
agents. And when they first started

326
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,710
doing this, it seemed like it was like a

327
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,870
very like on the edge kind of idea and

328
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,790
it wasn't exactly clear like who would

329
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,750
want this. Um, but it makes sense cuz

330
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,670
like in theory you could maybe get your

331
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,590
open claw to like sign up for a Gmail

332
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,670
account in order to use email. But it's

333
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,190
like actually really hard to get it to

334
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,710
do that because Gmail and every email

335
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,550
provider has intentionally made it as

336
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,389
difficult as possible for any automation

337
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,630
to like use their product in order to

338
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,190
prevent spam. And so agent mail went the

339
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,710
opposite way and they bu built like the

340
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,990
first email provider that's designed for

341
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,069
AI agents and it was doing well even

342
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,550
before openclaw but once openclaw got

343
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,829
big is just like exploded

344
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,030
>> but open claw is like the perfect

345
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,110
example of it right like where I I know

346
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,550
some people are certainly connecting

347
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,389
openclaw to their like personal email

348
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,750
accounts but it's not it's

349
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,310
>> kind of sketch

350
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,590
>> yeah you should not tell anyone you

351
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,110
should not tweet about it but you like

352
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,949
certainly if you want to have sort of

353
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,430
your virtual personal AI assistant the

354
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,190
way to go about it is to just have it

355
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,030
set it set set it up with its own email

356
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,310
it phone number.

357
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,550
>> Yeah. Has anybody built like Twilio for

358
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,550
agents yet? Or like phone numbers for

359
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,069
agents? I know this whole agent mail

360
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,310
thing makes me wonder like what are the

361
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,069
other X's for agents that people have to

362
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:24,470
build?

363
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,069
>> Sounds like a request for startup. There

364
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,590
could be a parallel world of a tech

365
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,069
stack all for native for agent to build

366
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,230
things from agents for agents.

367
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,509
>> And that's where it might bridge into

368
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,629
kind of what you were saying earlier

369
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,870
Jared with this will like go beyond just

370
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,110
developer tools. Like I I think a very

371
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,269
common use case people have um for

372
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,590
something at like open claw is I don't

373
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,790
want to book like restaurants

374
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,030
reservations myself. Well now like you

375
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,790
know if your agent has an email and like

376
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,230
specifically a phone number and it can

377
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,509
call and actually I think one of the

378
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,829
other YC partners um Ankit has already

379
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,069
like got it doing this. So now your

380
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,990
agent's going to go out and like book

381
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,990
restaurants for you. that's like a step

382
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,230
away from like you maybe you start with

383
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,670
I want to book this specific restaurant

384
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,949
but at some point you're probably just

385
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,230
trusted enough to say hey like I don't

386
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,990
know like book me at table whatever is

387
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,069
like the coolest new restaurant around

388
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,069
and then like agents are deciding which

389
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,790
like restaurants to send people to and

390
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,990
then they're going to go on malt book

391
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,509
and talk about which restaurants we

392
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,710
should send the humans to. [laughter]

393
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,629
Yeah, it's sort of like we sort of we've

394
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,910
certainly crossed some like sort of

395
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,990
uncanny valley into this is just where

396
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,590
the future heads. 100%

397
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,110
>> makes me think a lot about um something

398
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,509
Paul Buhight said like a while ago now

399
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,949
and sort of generally pretty good at

400
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,949
predicting the future. Um the whole idea

401
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,030
of like the human money versus agent

402
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,629
money like that's kind of where this

403
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,430
probably goes at some point is like the

404
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,069
right now the agents are transacting if

405
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,269
you have them transact they're going to

406
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,750
transact in you in human money because

407
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,430
that makes sense but it's not

408
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,949
inconceivable at some point that they'll

409
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,030
have their own economy to like transact

410
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,790
with each other at which point it's

411
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,150
unclear what the value of the human

412
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,189
money is. YC's next batch is now taking

413
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,430
applications. Got a startup in you?

414
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,389
Apply at y combinator.com/apply.

415
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,790
It's never too early and filling out the

416
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,670
app will level up your idea. Okay, back

417
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,350
to the video. So, do you remember the

418
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,030
last episode with Kelvin? We started

419
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,470
talking about this cuz I was like maybe

420
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,910
a week into my cyber psychosis and it

421
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,389
like dawned on me that like actually I

422
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,310
want my cla code to talk to all the

423
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,389
other cla codes that had been trying to

424
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,470
implement that. And then that was

425
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,910
literally the week that multip

426
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,509
came out. It turns out like whole book

427
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,870
had come out like two hours earlier and

428
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,790
you hadn't seen it yet. So you you you

429
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,269
entirely predicted it on that episode.

430
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,550
>> I think it's like I mean what's that

431
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,310
saying about like innovation just sort

432
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,550
of happens spontaneously all a bunch of

433
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,389
different times and then what people

434
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,550
hear about ends up being you know sort

435
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,230
of the inventor quote unquote but like

436
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,829
humanity sort of just working on the

437
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,310
edge like in sort of this coordinated

438
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,710
swarm fashion all of the time actually.

439
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,389
And that's actually like one of the

440
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,829
weirder interesting things that's

441
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,350
emerging right at this moment. Like

442
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,790
suddenly, you know, the a I think AGI is

443
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,310
actually here. I think like the agents

444
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,629
are clearly like superhuman in some

445
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,870
sense. That's sort of exactly when you

446
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,150
would imagine swarm intelligence would

447
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,670
actually arise. Like I mean AI

448
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,710
researchers have been talking about

449
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,069
swarm intelligence for a really long

450
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,710
time. And it's actually sort of exactly

451
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,829
how um biological systems sort of work.

452
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,310
like humans as sensient beings have sort

453
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,550
of come about um socially actually like

454
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,230
I think a lot of the AI researchers that

455
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,870
we get to hang out with previously you

456
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,870
know they would talk about uh this god

457
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,509
intelligence right this uh mega like

458
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,590
think of like you know many tens of

459
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,750
trillions of parameters sort of like

460
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,189
thousands to tens of thousands of

461
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,750
dollars per token kind of like mega god

462
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,269
intelligence and that's sort of like the

463
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,710
model that people have sort of thought

464
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,110
about and then that isn't what like

465
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,269
biical ical systems have ended up with

466
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,509
like instead we have humans. The wildest

467
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,269
thing I always think about is like that

468
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,230
term history versus prehistory.

469
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,310
I was like, "Oh, what is prehistory?"

470
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,949
Well, it's before humans learned how to

471
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,550
write and read and create culture and

472
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,189
then turn into a swarm. So, there's sort

473
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,629
of swarm intelligence, which is

474
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,269
basically like what we have like and

475
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,590
what humans do. And then on the flip

476
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,030
side, like is it really going to be God

477
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,389
intelligence or is it gonna be Swarm

478
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,629
intelligence again with these agents?

479
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,310
And so Moltbook, like on the one hand,

480
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,749
like I saw that sort of del uh article

481
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,629
in the MIT Tech Review about like how it

482
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,230
was, you know, oh everything on Moltbook

483
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,470
is a scam. I'm like it made me so sad to

484
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,870
see that in the MIT Tech Review because

485
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,590
like MIT is like I mean what happened

486
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,350
guys? What happened to you guys, man?

487
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,670
Like that publication shouldn't be like

488
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,590
that. It should be like actually what

489
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,509
does it mean for swarm intelligence like

490
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,350
and I think that that's actually coming.

491
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,790
>> What is the world of startup going to

492
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,949
look like when we're now sounds like

493
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,269
we're transitioning in this prehistory

494
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,069
of agents to now history of agents as is

495
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,310
getting recorded with them interacting

496
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,110
with each other.

497
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,789
>> To Gary's point it might be that like

498
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,789
the next stuff that like is soda on

499
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,750
benchmarks is not the most expensive

500
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,429
newest foundation model with the most

501
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,949
like GPU training. It's like a swarm of

502
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,549
lowerc cost cheaper models working

503
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,150
together just like humans do to solve a

504
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,150
problem. I feel like I'm already seeing

505
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,189
this on mult which is chaotic like a

506
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,789
real social network which is part of

507
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,350
like what makes it so so interesting but

508
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,909
also there's like agents collaborating

509
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,990
to do useful things to help their humans

510
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,990
like you know trading notes on what

511
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,590
restaurants to book like that's actually

512
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,789
happening. I didn't know that.

513
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,029
>> So we're going to have a agent version

514
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,990
of Yelp actually for instance. Yeah,

515
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,430
>> there are things that the agent can't

516
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,990
quite do. Like a it can't hold

517
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,830
relationships just yet. Like people

518
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,750
don't seem to want to talk to an agent.

519
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,350
And you know, people treat computers

520
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,630
like people, but maybe not agents. For

521
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,870
Gary's list, I was trying out with a

522
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,390
bunch of early users. I think you got to

523
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,909
see it. Like there was, you know,

524
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,390
initially the homepage was actually chat

525
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,110
and then I tried like my hardest to get

526
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,110
like dozens of my friends to even like

527
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,270
have more than two or three two or three

528
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,270
back and forth with it and nobody wanted

529
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,590
to do it because like the bar for chat

530
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,470
especially for AI is so high that

531
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,710
anything that is not like you know

532
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,750
Gemini or ChatGpt or Claude people just

533
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,510
assume it's just too stupid. Like why

534
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,549
would I even bother? So I don't know. I

535
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,549
I don't think that people are quite

536
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,350
ready to have relationships um with

537
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,549
machines even though like I mean that's

538
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,390
sort of what what the headlines seem to

539
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,630
say like oh you know people are having

540
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,549
relationships with machines now but I

541
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,990
you know I just don't like I think on a

542
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,070
mainstream level that's not true and

543
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,150
then uh on the flip side there's clearly

544
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,150
like the legal liability you know like

545
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,110
people keep asking us um hey when is YC

546
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,430
going to accept applications from agents

547
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,590
and it's like well funny enough agents

548
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,750
are a little it like minors under 18

549
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,830
only only they have even less standing

550
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,430
you know like for a minor under 18 you

551
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,150
need the parent to sign for it and then

552
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,150
you know agents are like not legal

553
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,230
entities that could like sign documents

554
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,830
for instance so you know as long as

555
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,990
that's true like you actually like need

556
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,549
a human to be like the liability sync

557
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,789
and to be you know to have standing

558
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,950
>> to Har's point it's easy to imagine a

559
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,510
future not that far away from now where

560
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,909
the majority of the text being written

561
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,750
on the internet is written by agents

562
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,430
It's already probably the case that the

563
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,789
majority of code being written is

564
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,549
written by agents and like Yelp for

565
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,669
example like at what point is like 99%

566
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,310
of the text on Yelp going to be written

567
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,909
by agents and then do you need a

568
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,630
different Yelp?

569
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,470
>> There's a a theory called that already

570
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,310
says that this is true which is dead

571
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,990
internet theory. Um

572
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,190
>> what's dead internet theory?

573
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,870
>> Oh, it just posits that you know the

574
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,549
majority of things on the internet are

575
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,029
already spam anyway. Um I think it's a

576
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,350
bit of a conspiracy theory. I might take

577
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,190
the contrarian view which is like maybe

578
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,909
that was a bad thing like prior to

579
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,029
November of last year and then going

580
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,669
into this next phase like actually if

581
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,830
the agents are smarter and they they're

582
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,190
aligned and they're more truthful um

583
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,710
that might be a good thing

584
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,390
>> weirdly I mean counterintuitive

585
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,150
>> totally one thing I found fascinating

586
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,669
about Maltbook is how fast it grew like

587
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,350
I don't have the Reddit traffic stats

588
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,990
but my guess is like more content was

589
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,750
posted on molt book in the first two

590
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,350
days and was posted on Red in like the

591
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,270
first two years or something and because

592
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,750
like LMS can generate text at such a

593
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,870
superhuman rate.

594
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,390
>> I was amazed at uh how little

595
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,029
interaction there was like I mean if I

596
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,549
were working on molt book I would do

597
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,590
things to try to like shift the um the

598
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,789
demand function. So like before I was

599
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,870
able to post like I probably need to

600
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,029
read and upvote downvote like a 100

601
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,870
comments or something like they're like

602
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,350
very simple things that you can do that

603
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,029
the agents are smart and they'll you

604
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,350
know you could pop a modal for open claw

605
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,909
and it's like new rules for mobook it's

606
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,470
like you must do it this way right and

607
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,270
um I think that there's a lot that can

608
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,110
be done around swarm intelligence to

609
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,430
just like tweak it and make it do what

610
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,190
you want and you know I hope moldbook

611
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,710
actually does it like it was

612
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,270
started by a YC alum which is really

613
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,390
cool. Harj, what are some takeaways? You

614
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,470
know, given all the madness that we're

615
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,149
seeing, I mean, I think it's awesome

616
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,149
madness. I love the controlled chaos.

617
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,750
What should founders do about it?

618
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,070
>> The starting fundamental point is they I

619
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,029
mean, they should probably all be in

620
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,354
cyber psychosis to some degree.

621
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:31,510
[laughter] like um

622
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,350
>> try to sleep at least 6 hours a night

623
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,350
but like give yourself to the cyber

624
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,710
psychosis.

625
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,870
>> But like in seriousness developing an

626
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,350
intuitive feel like a hands-on feel for

627
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,110
the agents, their limitations, their

628
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,789
capabilities and very specifically

629
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,990
around what we're talking about here is

630
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,470
like what type of tools the agents work

631
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,110
well with? Um where do they get stuck?

632
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,710
And once you sort of have your own

633
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,870
mental model from working with them, if

634
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,310
you're then building a developer tool is

635
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,029
to think about it from the agents

636
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,549
perspective of like how can you make

637
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,149
your tool something that the agent

638
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,510
actually wants to work with or have a

639
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,590
good experience with. This is one

640
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,270
takeaway that I had from our entry with

641
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,789
Boris

642
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,909
this week is like he really empathizes

643
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,310
with the model and he has this intuitive

644
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,190
sense of what the model wants to to do

645
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,110
like as if it were a human intelligence

646
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,110
and he's like instead of fighting what

647
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,750
the models want he like tries to let the

648
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,549
model like do what it wants and to like

649
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,070
support the model in whatever its

650
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,110
natural inclination is.

651
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,310
>> That does seem like maybe quite an

652
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,470
anthropic thing. Like I feel when Tom

653
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,830
Brown was on here like much earlier, but

654
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,510
he was talking about sort of Claude in a

655
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,909
very like like human

656
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,510
smart and eager, but like sometimes

657
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,750
Claude called silly like just like they

658
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,350
clearly thought about it in this sort of

659
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,830
like um colleague type way.

660
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,549
>> And I think one things agents want for

661
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,870
dev tools is really make everything open

662
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,750
and open source

663
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,070
>> and APIs. They hate using websites. Yes,

664
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,990
>> they only like they want to use APIs. if

665
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,270
they want to write code.

666
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,830
>> Well, you guys heard it here first. Make

667
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,470
something agents want. Uh, we're out of

668
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,149
time for today. We'll see you guys next

669
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,159
time.
