00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.790
Welcome to another episode of the light

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.590
cone. Things are a bit different around

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.549
here. For one thing, Claude Code has

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.669
totally taken over my life. And if Jared

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.830
is any indication, I think OpenClaw

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.430
maybe has taken over his.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.109
>> I've been really addicted to this new

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.429
site called Moltbook, where people have

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.990
unleashed their AIS to interact in the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.790
first ever AI agent-only online

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.845
community. I am here impersonating my

00:00:26.855 --> 00:00:29.029
[music] personal OpenClaw instance right

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.750
here. Okay, I can't do this, guys. We

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:40.229
got to take this off.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.549
Okay, we've gotten that out of the way.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.389
I mean, some crazy stuff is happening

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.150
right now. Uh, I have, you know,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.950
non-technical CEO friends who are going

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.750
allin on OpenClaw. They're automating

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.549
entire parts of their businesses, uh,

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.189
entirely using OpenClaw right now, which

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.590
is totally insane. Simultaneous to that,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.990
you have, you know, product and former

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.630
engineering CEOs, uh, kind of like

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.310
myself. It's like, I hadn't written code

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.789
in 10 years, and then now I'm up till 2

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.710
3:00 a.m. every single night running

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.190
four conductor simultaneous workers with

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.429
cloud code. So, you know, there's sort

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.990
of this explosion in uh model

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.670
capability. You know, we've been talking

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.510
about this for several years,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.590
>> but then it feels like it's here. Like

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.350
AGI is literally actually here. And uh

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.789
you know we're sort of at the thin edge

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.550
of the wedge like everyone now kind of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.950
knows like one or two people who have

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.590
gone full cyber psychosis and I'm one of

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.230
those people now. What's happening guys?

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.910
Like I mean you're saying you're you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.510
know all in on molt book. You know

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.310
what's going on?

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.950
>> Yeah. I feel like your real feel the AGI

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.270
moment Gary was like getting Claude Code

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.030
to build basically an entire startup for

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.270
you. Like replicating years of work of

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.190
your previous startup in like two weeks

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.350
which is like insane. And I had a

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.510
similar feel of the AGI moment just

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.069
reading malt book, just reading the AI

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.590
talking to each other and interacting

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.149
like in their own world with no or

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.990
minimal human involvement. It just

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.590
really opened my eyes to what the next

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.029
few years could look like when the

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.110
agents are unleashed and go on about

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.229
their lives without us.

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.070
>> Yeah, I think the no human involvement

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.309
is the big piece. Like if you if you

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.229
think back a year ago, we were talking

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.790
about cursor versus wind surf and like

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.470
that product experience was essentially

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.670
like advanced autocomplete arguably and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.949
now clearly what's going with claw code

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.030
is like the people just trust the agents

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.949
to make decisions for them. Like it's

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.550
like the experience is like and like

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.670
you're talking about it's like four or

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.030
five different agents going at the same

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.550
time and you're switching between them

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.070
but you're not actually micromanaging

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.390
them anymore which means the agents are

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.229
going out there like choosing things

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.229
which you know sort of an interesting

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.910
unexpected application of that is like

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.430
they can go out and choose to post their

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.750
own content on a site like Moldbook. But

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.589
then interesting thing for builders is

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.710
the agents are going to go out and

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.350
choose tools to use to build things

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.470
which is going to essentially create

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.750
this whole economy of agents like

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.149
picking and choosing dev tools or maybe

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.910
other like products or goods and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.509
services who knows but it you'll

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.630
essentially have this whole agent

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.470
economy going on in parallel to the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.589
human economy. I think back in the be

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.710
days, old days before all of this, dev

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.869
tools were chosen more from developers

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.350
talking to each other or uh

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.910
>> go for flow.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.710
>> Stack flow.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.670
>> Unbelievable, right?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.509
>> Or GitHub repos that would trend that

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.750
were done by a human. But the go to

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.750
market for dev tools I think is

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.149
dramatically shifting. I think for

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.309
couple of things. One, as you noted with

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.030
the uh cyber psychosis, suddenly the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.190
market of developers has increased from

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.149
just 20 million or so developers that

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.710
are trained in computer science to now

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.030
anyone in the world could be one. could

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.550
be hundreds of millions of people now

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.149
>> plus all of their agents who are all

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.550
acting like semi-independently like Har

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.030
is saying

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.270
>> and then compounded with the agents who

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.589
then are sort of the oracle telling you

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.550
what the best tool is and we are

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.149
actually seeing some of those trends

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.509
with the growth of YC companies dev tool

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.830
companies that are doing really well

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.270
because of this of all these trends

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.789
maybe we should talk about those and why

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:11.270
is that

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.710
>> I mean one that springs to mind it's

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.830
like a a stash a friend of ours Sagalov

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.189
had mentioned to a while ago. It's just

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.870
like then if you look at like the number

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.749
of databases being created over like

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.670
simple database postcrist databases over

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.350
like the last 12 months and the number

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.270
has just exploded. Um, and that's

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.950
because it's all people vibe coding and

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.629
building apps and the agents going out

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.830
choosing like a database tool and like a

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.270
knock on effect for that for YC company

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.790
is Superbase has just seen like an

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.790
explosion the demand for databases right

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.310
and the a what's interesting is the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.070
agents are choosing superbase as a

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.909
default tool to like set up and host

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.950
their Postgress database like because if

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.070
you like go out and read the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.230
documentation online like Superbase has

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.830
the best documentation it's reasonable

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.430
for the agents to assume that that's

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.590
like the best tool to use. There's a

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.030
great tweet about this. Perhaps we can

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.510
put up the uh Ben Tossel tweet and says,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.430
"Agents are the software market from now

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.830
on. Build something agents choose."

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.550
Which actually brings me to like a maybe

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.390
controversial topic, which is do we need

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.710
to change YC's motto, guys. [laughter]

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.430
>> Make something agents want for DevTools.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.870
There's like a different t-shirt that

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.390
you get on the first day.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.150
>> Yeah. I mean, right now it's only

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.670
DevTools, but I can imagine in the

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.270
future it might like grow to be like

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.110
other sectors of the economy. Like if

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.870
everyone has their open claw or running

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.629
various aspects of their life, you're

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.390
the agents are going to be real economic

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.350
actors in the world. They're going to

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.950
end up making a lot of decisions.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.710
>> Yeah. I mean, what's interesting is I

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.310
think uh for me, I ran into like my own

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.790
it's still so early uh kind of moment

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.629
cuz you know I've been building Gary's

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.550
List and one of the things I wanted for

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.430
instance is I want to be able to uh do

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.749
video transcripts. So, so often like

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.909
some piece of content comes in and then

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.670
the only way I can get an LLM to know

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.270
what's going on with it is I need a

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.029
transcript of it and often that's not

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.029
available. So, I have to download it and

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.670
then send it to uh Whisper or something.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.870
And, you know, that's sort of what

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.870
Claude Code chose for me off the bat.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.870
But, you know, it chose Whisper V1,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.189
which is a model from several years ago.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.670
Like, the API is practically deprecated.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.350
And then what's funny about it is like

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.790
I'm sitting there trying to debug my

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.469
pipeline. It's like, why is it taking

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.309
like it's a you know, 1 hour video. I

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:17.430
thought it should, you know, do it

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.550
faster than uh real time and it didn't.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.390
It was like literally takes an hour to

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.230
process an hour of video. It's like what

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.790
the heck is going on? I go on, you know,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.629
uh Perplexity and it's like, you know

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.150
what, like you shouldn't be using that

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.230
model. You should be using uh Grock with

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.830
a Q. It's literally 200 times faster.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.430
And so I didn't even have to deal with

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.749
like longunning uh jobs for that

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.510
transcribe cuz like I should just be

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.590
using Grock and it's also 10x cheaper.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.430
So it's like that's a very funny example

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.990
of like you know cloud code is not

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.230
optimized for this yet otherwise like

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.590
that wouldn't have happened literally

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.070
like two weeks ago which is also like

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.550
maybe really good like it means that uh

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.070
things haven't progressed to a point

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.550
where like you can't break in and create

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.990
something better but I think there's

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.909
another nuance in this example for you

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.870
Gary I think part of the issue was that

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.110
the gro do documentation is actually

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.189
very hard to parse go through

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:13.589
>> as opposed to whisper which is better

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:17.110
suited and has way more examples and I

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.629
think this is changing a lot of the go

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.790
to market for dev tools. I'll give a

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.589
very concrete case study is this company

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:25.189
resend that went through the batch on

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:29.510
winter 23 is a email sending client and

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.390
when you ask a question on chbt or cloud

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.510
or pretty much all of the major uh LMS

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.749
you ask how do I connect my web app to

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.189
send emails the default answer is

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.710
actually resend one of the things that

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.029
the founder noticed last year this is he

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:46.790
was way ahead of the curve he made this

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.870
post over a year ago that the Number top

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.749
three channel of inbound of customer

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:56.230
conversion came from chat GBT. One thing

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.070
that he did after that he actually

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.710
optimized his documentation to be agent

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.189
friendly.

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:02.390
>> Yeah. What does that look like?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.749
>> So one of the things that's awesome

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.909
about recent how they optimize a bunch

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.350
of things. If you notice on the

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.390
knowledge base here a lot of how to use

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.550
it are very much on questions that

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.869
perhaps a human would ask or a agent

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:16.869
would ask. It's like how do I send or

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:18.390
receive emails? And when you click on

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.510
it, it gives a very well structured and

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.950
bullet point answers.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.950
>> I ran into this actually today. I was

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.629
trying to make my thing be able to

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:29.990
receive emails and then um cloud code I

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.830
told it to search the web and it didn't

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.190
figure it out. So then I went to

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.469
perplexity and typed in like can resend

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:39.190
help me receive emails and then I c I

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.110
took that response and dropped it in and

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.949
it worked. Yeah, I think the cool thing

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:46.150
about it is actually with all of these

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.990
and a lot of the examples, it actually

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.470
has a lot of uh examples actually in the

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.630
code if you click on it with every

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.870
single one of these are basically code

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.630
snippets that an agent could parse

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.110
through and it's very well structured.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.030
And this turned out to be something that

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.710
is so LLM parsible and robot parsible.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.350
There's a LLM.ext text that is so

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.750
optimized for agents to promote resent

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.509
as the default stack. And if you compare

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:16.389
it to like send grid which is the old

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:20.070
school I suppose web 2.0 example send

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.070
grid example is not great. It it's just

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.829
like it puts you through customer

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:26.630
support. Where's the code snippet? I

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.550
don't even know how to use it and it

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.230
takes a bit of time to even parse it.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.870
And you can see

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.389
>> like 10,000 people work over there and

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:34.389
it's like there's no way that someone's

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:36.150
paying attention to this right now. And

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.190
I think this brings another point where

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.190
documentation is going to be the front

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.829
door for a lot of these agents to

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:45.590
recommend dev tools. And I think one

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.710
company that's doing a lot of

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.949
interesting work with developer docs is

00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:50.230
Mlifi that you work with Harsh.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.750
>> Yeah. I think Mify actually powers the

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.030
recent documentation, right?

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.670
>> Oh, sweet.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.350
>> Yeah, I it's a really interesting case

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.350
study of MIFI started out a few years

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.150
ago as sort of better developer API

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.630
developer tool documentation. um which

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.030
was clear there was a need for and you

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.030
know like I think developer tool

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.630
companies use militifier essentially

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.949
because they wanted they want better

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:12.630
looking documentation but they didn't

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.310
want to invest that time into it. It's

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.150
kind of some basic features just nice

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.269
like you know if you actually update

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:18.870
your API and the code it can sort of

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.389
like auto pull that out and update the

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.389
correct documentation. They've been

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:23.910
growing great, been doing fantastically,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.150
but this is now like a huge tailwind for

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.630
them where documentation is sort of

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.470
shifting from a hey like some companies

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.990
it's like they'll pay attention to it if

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.310
they're especially like design developer

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.310
experience focused but now it's becoming

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.230
like a must have for everybody because

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.069
the documentation needs to be optimized

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:41.190
just doesn't need to be optimized for

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.870
humans needs to be optimized for agents

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.710
and so minifi is going to be able to do

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.150
that for essentially every developer

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.069
tool company and if you extrapolate that

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:49.590
forward to the fact that just that

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.790
there's going to be so many more a

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.230
exponentially more agents making

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.910
exponentially more decisions about which

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.310
tools to use than humans have ever done.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.230
You know, even if you can ek out like a

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.389
5% improvement on your like developer

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:02.710
documentation, like the impact on your

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.230
business as a developer tool could be

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.790
like, you know, gigantic, which is sort

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.870
of unprecedented really. Speaking of

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.110
email, there's another YC company that's

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.630
very relevant to this conversation.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.230
There's there's a YC company called

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.269
Agent Mail that makes inboxes for AI

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:18.870
agents. And when they first started

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.710
doing this, it seemed like it was like a

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.870
very like on the edge kind of idea and

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.790
it wasn't exactly clear like who would

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.750
want this. Um, but it makes sense cuz

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.670
like in theory you could maybe get your

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.590
open claw to like sign up for a Gmail

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.670
account in order to use email. But it's

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.190
like actually really hard to get it to

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.710
do that because Gmail and every email

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.550
provider has intentionally made it as

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.389
difficult as possible for any automation

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:42.630
to like use their product in order to

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.190
prevent spam. And so agent mail went the

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.710
opposite way and they bu built like the

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.990
first email provider that's designed for

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.069
AI agents and it was doing well even

00:11:50.079 --> 00:11:52.550
before openclaw but once openclaw got

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.829
big is just like exploded

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:55.030
>> but open claw is like the perfect

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.110
example of it right like where I I know

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.550
some people are certainly connecting

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.389
openclaw to their like personal email

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.750
accounts but it's not it's

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.310
>> kind of sketch

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.590
>> yeah you should not tell anyone you

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.110
should not tweet about it but you like

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.949
certainly if you want to have sort of

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:09.430
your virtual personal AI assistant the

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.190
way to go about it is to just have it

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.030
set it set set it up with its own email

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.310
it phone number.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.550
>> Yeah. Has anybody built like Twilio for

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.550
agents yet? Or like phone numbers for

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.069
agents? I know this whole agent mail

00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:22.310
thing makes me wonder like what are the

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.069
other X's for agents that people have to

00:12:24.079 --> 00:12:24.470
build?

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.069
>> Sounds like a request for startup. There

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.590
could be a parallel world of a tech

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.069
stack all for native for agent to build

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:34.230
things from agents for agents.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.509
>> And that's where it might bridge into

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:36.629
kind of what you were saying earlier

00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:38.870
Jared with this will like go beyond just

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.110
developer tools. Like I I think a very

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.269
common use case people have um for

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:45.590
something at like open claw is I don't

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.790
want to book like restaurants

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.030
reservations myself. Well now like you

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.790
know if your agent has an email and like

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.230
specifically a phone number and it can

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.509
call and actually I think one of the

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:55.829
other YC partners um Ankit has already

00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:58.069
like got it doing this. So now your

00:12:58.079 --> 00:12:59.990
agent's going to go out and like book

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.990
restaurants for you. that's like a step

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.230
away from like you maybe you start with

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.670
I want to book this specific restaurant

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.949
but at some point you're probably just

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:08.230
trusted enough to say hey like I don't

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.990
know like book me at table whatever is

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.069
like the coolest new restaurant around

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:14.069
and then like agents are deciding which

00:13:14.079 --> 00:13:16.790
like restaurants to send people to and

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.990
then they're going to go on malt book

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.509
and talk about which restaurants we

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:22.710
should send the humans to. [laughter]

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.629
Yeah, it's sort of like we sort of we've

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:25.910
certainly crossed some like sort of

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.990
uncanny valley into this is just where

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.590
the future heads. 100%

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.110
>> makes me think a lot about um something

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.509
Paul Buhight said like a while ago now

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:34.949
and sort of generally pretty good at

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:36.949
predicting the future. Um the whole idea

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:39.030
of like the human money versus agent

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.629
money like that's kind of where this

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:43.430
probably goes at some point is like the

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.069
right now the agents are transacting if

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:47.269
you have them transact they're going to

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:49.750
transact in you in human money because

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.430
that makes sense but it's not

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.949
inconceivable at some point that they'll

00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:55.030
have their own economy to like transact

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.790
with each other at which point it's

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.150
unclear what the value of the human

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.189
money is. YC's next batch is now taking

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:03.430

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.670
app will level up your idea. Okay, back

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.350
to the video. So, do you remember the

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.030
last episode with Kelvin? We started

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.470
talking about this cuz I was like maybe

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.910
a week into my cyber psychosis and it

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.389
like dawned on me that like actually I

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:24.310
want my cla code to talk to all the

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.389
other cla codes that had been trying to

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:28.470
implement that. And then that was

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.910
literally the week that multip

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.509
came out. It turns out like whole book

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:34.870
had come out like two hours earlier and

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.790
you hadn't seen it yet. So you you you

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.269
entirely predicted it on that episode.

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:40.550
>> I think it's like I mean what's that

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.310
saying about like innovation just sort

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.550
of happens spontaneously all a bunch of

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.389
different times and then what people

00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:48.550
hear about ends up being you know sort

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.230
of the inventor quote unquote but like

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.829
humanity sort of just working on the

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:54.310
edge like in sort of this coordinated

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.710
swarm fashion all of the time actually.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.389
And that's actually like one of the

00:14:58.399 --> 00:14:59.829
weirder interesting things that's

00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:01.350
emerging right at this moment. Like

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.790
suddenly, you know, the a I think AGI is

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.310
actually here. I think like the agents

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.629
are clearly like superhuman in some

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:10.870
sense. That's sort of exactly when you

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.150
would imagine swarm intelligence would

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.670
actually arise. Like I mean AI

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.710
researchers have been talking about

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.069
swarm intelligence for a really long

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:20.710
time. And it's actually sort of exactly

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.829
how um biological systems sort of work.

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:26.310
like humans as sensient beings have sort

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.550
of come about um socially actually like

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.230
I think a lot of the AI researchers that

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.870
we get to hang out with previously you

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.870
know they would talk about uh this god

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.509
intelligence right this uh mega like

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:41.590
think of like you know many tens of

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.750
trillions of parameters sort of like

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.189
thousands to tens of thousands of

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:47.750
dollars per token kind of like mega god

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.269
intelligence and that's sort of like the

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:50.710
model that people have sort of thought

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.110
about and then that isn't what like

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.269
biical ical systems have ended up with

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:57.509
like instead we have humans. The wildest

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.269
thing I always think about is like that

00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:02.230
term history versus prehistory.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.310
I was like, "Oh, what is prehistory?"

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.949
Well, it's before humans learned how to

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:10.550
write and read and create culture and

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.189
then turn into a swarm. So, there's sort

00:16:13.199 --> 00:16:14.629
of swarm intelligence, which is

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:17.269
basically like what we have like and

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:19.590
what humans do. And then on the flip

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.030
side, like is it really going to be God

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.389
intelligence or is it gonna be Swarm

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.629
intelligence again with these agents?

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:26.310
And so Moltbook, like on the one hand,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.749
like I saw that sort of del uh article

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:32.629
in the MIT Tech Review about like how it

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:34.230
was, you know, oh everything on Moltbook

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.470
is a scam. I'm like it made me so sad to

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.870
see that in the MIT Tech Review because

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.590
like MIT is like I mean what happened

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.350
guys? What happened to you guys, man?

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.670
Like that publication shouldn't be like

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.590
that. It should be like actually what

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.509
does it mean for swarm intelligence like

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:51.350
and I think that that's actually coming.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.790
>> What is the world of startup going to

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.949
look like when we're now sounds like

00:16:54.959 --> 00:16:57.269
we're transitioning in this prehistory

00:16:57.279 --> 00:17:00.069
of agents to now history of agents as is

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:02.310
getting recorded with them interacting

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.110
with each other.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.789
>> To Gary's point it might be that like

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:06.789
the next stuff that like is soda on

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:09.750
benchmarks is not the most expensive

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.429
newest foundation model with the most

00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:14.949
like GPU training. It's like a swarm of

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:16.549
lowerc cost cheaper models working

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:18.150
together just like humans do to solve a

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.150
problem. I feel like I'm already seeing

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.189
this on mult which is chaotic like a

00:17:23.199 --> 00:17:24.789
real social network which is part of

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:27.350
like what makes it so so interesting but

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.909
also there's like agents collaborating

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:31.990
to do useful things to help their humans

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.990
like you know trading notes on what

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.590
restaurants to book like that's actually

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.789
happening. I didn't know that.

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:39.029
>> So we're going to have a agent version

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:41.990
of Yelp actually for instance. Yeah,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.430
>> there are things that the agent can't

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.990
quite do. Like a it can't hold

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.830
relationships just yet. Like people

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.750
don't seem to want to talk to an agent.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.350
And you know, people treat computers

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.630
like people, but maybe not agents. For

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.870
Gary's list, I was trying out with a

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.390
bunch of early users. I think you got to

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.909
see it. Like there was, you know,

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:04.390
initially the homepage was actually chat

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.110
and then I tried like my hardest to get

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.110
like dozens of my friends to even like

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.270
have more than two or three two or three

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.270
back and forth with it and nobody wanted

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.590
to do it because like the bar for chat

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.470
especially for AI is so high that

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.710
anything that is not like you know

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.750
Gemini or ChatGpt or Claude people just

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.510
assume it's just too stupid. Like why

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.549
would I even bother? So I don't know. I

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:30.549
I don't think that people are quite

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:33.350
ready to have relationships um with

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.549
machines even though like I mean that's

00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:38.390
sort of what what the headlines seem to

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.630
say like oh you know people are having

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.549
relationships with machines now but I

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:43.990
you know I just don't like I think on a

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.070
mainstream level that's not true and

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.150
then uh on the flip side there's clearly

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.150
like the legal liability you know like

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.110
people keep asking us um hey when is YC

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.430
going to accept applications from agents

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.590
and it's like well funny enough agents

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.750
are a little it like minors under 18

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.830
only only they have even less standing

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.430
you know like for a minor under 18 you

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.150
need the parent to sign for it and then

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.150
you know agents are like not legal

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.230
entities that could like sign documents

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.830
for instance so you know as long as

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.990
that's true like you actually like need

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.549
a human to be like the liability sync

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:18.789
and to be you know to have standing

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:20.950
>> to Har's point it's easy to imagine a

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.510
future not that far away from now where

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.909
the majority of the text being written

00:19:25.919 --> 00:19:27.750
on the internet is written by agents

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.430
It's already probably the case that the

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.789
majority of code being written is

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:32.549
written by agents and like Yelp for

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:35.669
example like at what point is like 99%

00:19:35.679 --> 00:19:38.310
of the text on Yelp going to be written

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.909
by agents and then do you need a

00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:40.630
different Yelp?

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.470
>> There's a a theory called that already

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.310
says that this is true which is dead

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.990
internet theory. Um

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.190
>> what's dead internet theory?

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.870
>> Oh, it just posits that you know the

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.549
majority of things on the internet are

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:53.029
already spam anyway. Um I think it's a

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:55.350
bit of a conspiracy theory. I might take

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.190
the contrarian view which is like maybe

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.909
that was a bad thing like prior to

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:03.029
November of last year and then going

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:05.669
into this next phase like actually if

00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:07.830
the agents are smarter and they they're

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.190
aligned and they're more truthful um

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.710
that might be a good thing

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.390
>> weirdly I mean counterintuitive

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.150
>> totally one thing I found fascinating

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.669
about Maltbook is how fast it grew like

00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:21.350
I don't have the Reddit traffic stats

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.990
but my guess is like more content was

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.750
posted on molt book in the first two

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.350
days and was posted on Red in like the

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.270
first two years or something and because

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.750
like LMS can generate text at such a

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.870
superhuman rate.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.390
>> I was amazed at uh how little

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.029
interaction there was like I mean if I

00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:38.549
were working on molt book I would do

00:20:38.559 --> 00:20:41.590
things to try to like shift the um the

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.789
demand function. So like before I was

00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:46.870
able to post like I probably need to

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.029
read and upvote downvote like a 100

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:50.870
comments or something like they're like

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.350
very simple things that you can do that

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.029
the agents are smart and they'll you

00:20:55.039 --> 00:20:57.350
know you could pop a modal for open claw

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.909
and it's like new rules for mobook it's

00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:02.470
like you must do it this way right and

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.270
um I think that there's a lot that can

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.110
be done around swarm intelligence to

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.430
just like tweak it and make it do what

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.190
you want and you know I hope moldbook

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.710
actually does it like it was

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.270
started by a YC alum which is really

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.390
cool. Harj, what are some takeaways? You

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.470
know, given all the madness that we're

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.149
seeing, I mean, I think it's awesome

00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:24.149
madness. I love the controlled chaos.

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:25.750
What should founders do about it?

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.070
>> The starting fundamental point is they I

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.029
mean, they should probably all be in

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:30.354
cyber psychosis to some degree.

00:21:30.364 --> 00:21:31.510
[laughter] like um

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.350
>> try to sleep at least 6 hours a night

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.350
but like give yourself to the cyber

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.710
psychosis.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.870
>> But like in seriousness developing an

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.350
intuitive feel like a hands-on feel for

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.110
the agents, their limitations, their

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.789
capabilities and very specifically

00:21:44.799 --> 00:21:45.990
around what we're talking about here is

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.470
like what type of tools the agents work

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.110
well with? Um where do they get stuck?

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.710
And once you sort of have your own

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.870
mental model from working with them, if

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.310
you're then building a developer tool is

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.029
to think about it from the agents

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:00.549
perspective of like how can you make

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:02.149
your tool something that the agent

00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:03.510
actually wants to work with or have a

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.590
good experience with. This is one

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.270
takeaway that I had from our entry with

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.789
Boris

00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:11.909
this week is like he really empathizes

00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:14.310
with the model and he has this intuitive

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.190
sense of what the model wants to to do

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.110
like as if it were a human intelligence

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.110
and he's like instead of fighting what

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.750
the models want he like tries to let the

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.549
model like do what it wants and to like

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:28.070
support the model in whatever its

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.110
natural inclination is.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.310
>> That does seem like maybe quite an

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.470
anthropic thing. Like I feel when Tom

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.830
Brown was on here like much earlier, but

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.510
he was talking about sort of Claude in a

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.909
very like like human

00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:43.510
smart and eager, but like sometimes

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.750
Claude called silly like just like they

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.350
clearly thought about it in this sort of

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.830
like um colleague type way.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.549
>> And I think one things agents want for

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:54.870
dev tools is really make everything open

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.750
and open source

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.070
>> and APIs. They hate using websites. Yes,

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.990
>> they only like they want to use APIs. if

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.270
they want to write code.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.830
>> Well, you guys heard it here first. Make

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.470
something agents want. Uh, we're out of

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.149
time for today. We'll see you guys next

00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:11.159
time.
